You'll need this tag to reference the group later.\n\nDeleting a group from the list is just as easy:\n\n[delete group group-tag] --> /how_to_delete_group\n\nOnce you've added all the groups you want to manage, you can start sending messages to them using the bot. To do this, use the following command:\n\n[/run_managing]\n\nThis will enable the bot to automatically forward any messages you send to the groups you've added. Remember to include the group tag when sending your messages!\n\nWith these simple commands, you can easily manage multiple groups at once and streamline your communication efforts.",
